		<p>A <i>SoftwareComponent</i> is a specialized Deployment Unit that 
		describes an indivisible set of <i>Service</i>s and <i>Reference</i>s 
		corresponding to a technology-specific business module and 
		may declare <i>DependencyLinks</i> that refer to other (target) 
		<i>SoftwareComponents</i>. A <i>SoftwareComponent</i>
		may not be further decomposed (hence the indivisibility) by the
		Business Application Domain model. [A future enhancement may allow
		Composite Units (like <i>unit.composite</i>) that describe reusable
		configurations of <i>SoftwareComponents</i> and <i>Units</i>.] 
		</p>
		<p>
		A <i>SoftwareComponent</i> describes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
				<i>A buildable component</i>: A SoftwareComponent in our model is a grouping of
				artifacts that a build system could use to coordinate the compilation of artifacts. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<i>An atomic business contract</i>: A SoftwareComponent may describe Services and
				References that it exposes; or it may expose no Services/References. However, we
				will not model the internals of the SoftwareComponent with any greater level of
				detail than the outer Service contract it exposes; even if empty. Like <i>Unit</i>, 
				<i>SoftwareComponent</i> may also expose <i>Capabilities</i> or <i>Requirements</i> 
				that do not conform to a well known business contract. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<i>Packaging/Build dependencies through <i>DependencyLinks</i></i>: A set of
				<i>SoftwareComponents</i> (like an EAR Module "contains" an EJB Module) will be
				captured by <i>DependencyLinks</i> from <i>Requirements</i> to <i>BundleCapabilities</i>, allowing
				decisions about how the artifacts are to be packaged left up to a
				Builder/Deployer role. For instance, a <i>WebModule</i> (specialization of <i>SoftwareComponent</i>) may have
				<i>DependencyLink</i> to a <i>UtilityJar</i> (specialization of <i>SoftwareComponent</i>). 
				</p>
				<p>
				A packager may choose to put the built utility jar under the WEB-INF/lib or in a shared 
				libraries folder on the Web Container using some other packaging-related metamodel. 
				Modeling the dependency as "containment" in our model would 
				circumvent the ability to break this module out without modifying the architecture model. 
				Furthermore, our <i>HostingLinks</i> are not designed to describe subunits as their source; 
				hence we could not break out the modules "within" an EAR to different servers. Under our
				current approach of using <i>DependencyLinks</i> to describe what module an EAR depends
				on, each module could be hosted to a different server, assuming the business
				dependencies between them allow it. 
				</p>
			</li>

		<IMG border="0" src="SoftwareComponent.jpg"> 
		<p>
		Each <i>SoftwareComponent</i> is specialized based on the backing technology 
		and defines information about its backing implementation. Unlike the SCA model, 
		there is no specific specialized <i>Implementation</i> model element. A resolution 
		framework (UnitProvider) will allow different technology types to accept their 
		components and determine a set of <i>Services</i> and <i>References</i> 
		provided/required. The <i>SoftwareComponent</i> must provide enough information 
		for the technology specific resolvers to locate the artifacts required to derive the 
		set of <i>Services</i> and <i>References</i>. In addition, configurable elements 
		of the technology type (e.g. <i>displayName</i>) may be exposed as attributes or 
		elements on the specialized type to provide functionality similar to SCA's <i>Properties</i>.		
		</p>
		<p>The <i>SoftwareComponent</i> elements will be of the form <b>component.xxx</b> 
		where "xxx" is a suffix chosen by the technology domain providing the element definition. The
		subtypes of <i>SoftwareComponents</i> should follow a naming convention that is most
		appropriate for their specific domain.</p>

		A <i>Service</i> coordinates its individual contract with a <i>Reference</i> via an <i>Interface</i>.  <i>Services</i>
		are specialized based on the specific middleware or communication technology (e.g. <i>service.ejb</i> or <i>service.ws</i>)
		and may imply certain <i>CommunicationCapabilities</i> on nodes which host them.
		<i>References</i> may eventually be specialized, but in the short term will be implemented as just "vanilla" 
		types that declare a required <i>Interface</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
		An <i>Interface</i> represents a set of logical business operations for a particular programming language or 
		model. Examples of <i>Interfaces</i> include <i>interface.java</i> and <i>interface.ddl</i>. An <i>Interface</i> 
		does not necessarily imply how the service is exposed; since something like <i>interface.java</i> 
		might be used for both <i>service.ejb</i> and <i>service.sca</i>. The actual set of logical business operations is 
		not captured directly by the Business Application Domain model. 
		</p>		
		<img border="0" src="ServiceContract.jpg">
		<p>
		A matching framework will be used to compare <i>Interfaces</i> of the same technology type. Some <i>Interface
		</i>types may describe a normalization to some common <i>Interface</i> type (e.g. <i>interface.wsdl</i>) in order 
		to match <i>interfaces</i> of different technology types, but only where that kind of flexibility is allowed. Matching rules for 
		different technology types may vary; where some matching semantics may require a matching type/package/version 
		(e.g. <i>interface.java</i>), others may only require that the target provide a superset of the required operations from the 
		source (e.g. <i>interface.wsdl</i>). 
		</p>
		<p>
		We anticipate the creation of <i>Services/References/Interfaces</i> from the editor might use the SOA Assembly 
		Framework (SAF) to provide for the creation of specialized model types. It's likely that the SAF will piggyback or 
		integrate with the UnitProvider framework.

</table>
<table width="500">
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p>A <a href="../Requirement.html">requirement</a> defines a need on a 
		given <a href="../Capability.html">capability</a> type and may require 
		that a set of <a href="../RequirementExpression.html">RequirementExpressions</a>
		be satisfied.</p>
		Traditionally, a single <a href="../DependencyLink.html">dependency link</a>
		links a requirement to a satisfying capability.
		In some cases, a unit is dependent on a number of other units.  
		This dependency can be expressed using multiple requirements.
		However, it is often not known in advance how many such requirements there are.
		For example, a class loader depends on one or more shared libraries.
		This number is variable and depends on how the user wishes to configure the class loader.
		</p>
		<p><b>Use Cases</b>
		<ol>
		   <li>Class loader dependencies on shared libraries.</li>
		   <li>Shared library dependencies on utility jars.</li>
		   <li>Authentication entry dependencies on a user.</li>
		   <li>Datasource requirements on a database in a cluster.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><b>Options</b>
		<ol>
		   <li>Do not create dependency links.  Use Domain specific validation to ensure that the
		   relationship between the units is satisfied.  This is done, for example for the relationship
		   between a J2CAuthenticationEntry and a user on a targert OS.  Because the entry could be
		   used to refer to the same user on multiple OSes, no link is created.  Data source validation
		   ensures that the user identified in the authentication entry is present on the OS of the 
		   machine hosting the target database.</li>
		   <li>Dynamically create the requirement when a link is desired.  This approach provides no
		   good way to delete the requirement when the link is deleted.  In this case, a bit on the 
		   requirement could be used indicate that it is a "dynamic" requirement that should not 
		   exist without a valid dependency link.</li>
		   <li>Allow a Requirement to have multiple dependency links.  For a dependency link to be
		   valid, the requirement would need to be satisfied by the target capability of the link.
		   In this case, the requirement need not be removed when a link is removed. On the other
		   hand, this approach does not provide a means to ensure that the right number of dependency
		   links are satisfied.
		</ol>
		<p><b>Design</b>
		</br>
		Use the third approach:
		<ol>
		   <li>Add boolean field "allowMultipleDependencies" to Requirement</li>
		   <li>Change Requirement to return a list of DependencyLinks</li>
		   <li>Rewrite Requirement#getLink() to return the single link if only one is present 
		   and to return an exception if more than one is present.</li>
		   <li>Introduce getLinks() that returns a list of DependencyLink
		   <li>Add (core) validation that checks:
		      <ul>
		         <li>At most one link is present if <tt>allowMultipleDependencies</tt> is <tt>false</tt>.
		         <li>When <tt>allowMultipleDependencies</tt> is <tt>true</tt> ensure that
                 each target Capability satisfies the source Requirement.</li>
		      </ul>
		   </li> 
		   <li>Modify DependencyLinkMatcher to allow more than one link from a Requirement where 
		   <tt>allowsMultipleDependencies</tt> is <tt>true</tt></li>
		   <li>Ensure proxy layer support for multiple links.</li>
		   <li>Ensure error markers are on the links; not the source unit.</li>
		   <li>Enable UI to visualize multiple links</li>
		   <li>Modify property pages to show multiple links</li>
