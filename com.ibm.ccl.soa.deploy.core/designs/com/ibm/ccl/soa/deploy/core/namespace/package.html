		<p>The NamespaceFragment
		is an object that represents a physical location of a topology within an eclipse workspace. There is a need to be able to organize Topologies within a workspace. It is the purpose of the Namespace api to provide a similar ability as the package structure of java classes within an application. The NamespaceFragment represents a particular physical location within a workspace which is slightly different than the package semantics of a java class. In a java package the actual physical location is not known like it is in our NamespaceFragment. In a java package it is possible to have two files reside in the same package but be located in two physicaly different locations on the filesystem, but if two Topologies are said to reside in the same NamespaceFragment then they would reside in the same physical location within the workspace. As a future enchancement I would like to see the namespace api treated as a first class citizen within the Topology core api. I would like to see the introduction of an Namespace object that would represent the semantic grouping of Topologies within a given workspace without any implications toward the physical location of the Topologies the same way that java packages work for java classes today. I believe that this will become more necessary if Topology objects begin to support &quot;imported&quot; or &quot;referenced&quot; Topology Units. A unique identifier utilizing a Namespace as the prefix for the unique identifier for a Topology Unit within a Topology would be greatly beneficial in effeciently locating such &quot;imported&quot; Topology Units. </p>

		<p>A NamespaceFragment represents a physical location within a workspace. NamespaceFragments are &quot;backed&quot; by IResource objects. In the case of a NamespaceFragment, this underlying IResource object will always be a instance of IFolder. The NamespaceFragment object gives access to this resource through it's api getCorrespondingResource() but be aware the the value returned is an instance of IResource from the eclipse resource api and represents a handle to a resource on the file system and as such does not garuntee the existence or availability of such a resource.</p>

		<td width="721"><p> A NamespaceFragmentRoot is used as a container for NamespaceFragment and Topology objects within a workspace. All NamespaceFragment and Topology objects should be contained within a NamespaceFragmentRoot. For the purpose of deployment tooling the NamespaceFragmentRoot provides a convient way for the tools to &quot;know&quot; when to treat certain files and folders as deployment artifacts rather than as regular files and folders contained within the workspace. </p>
		<p>The underlying resources for NamespaceFragmentRoot objects are
		tracked on a per project basis by the TopologyNamespaceRootIndex
		class. There are a couple of ways in which a new topology namespace root can be added to the index for a project. </p>
		<p>If a new Topology file is created within the workspace a class
		called the ModelFileIndexer ( which can be obtained through the
		DeployCorePlugin class ) is notified of it's creation through it's
		resource change listener. The model file indexer maintains a list
		classes that have registered their interest in being notified of the
		creation of new topology model files to the workspace. During startup
		of the deploy core plugin a class called NamespaceRootIndexer
		registers it's interest with the ModelFileIndexer. The
		NamespaceRootIndexer maintains an index of NamespaceRootIndex classes
		that are keyed off of Project names ( one per project ). The
		NamespaceRootIndexer will notify the NamespaceRootIndex class for the
		project that a new topology file was created in or create a new
		instance of NamespaceRootIndex if one does not already exist for a
		project. The NamespaceRootIndex will determine if a
		NamespaceFragmentRoot already exists for a given IResource and avoid
		creating a new NamespaceFragmentRoot if so, or add the IResource to
		it's index if no NamespaceFragmentRoot can be found along the passed
		in IResource's path.</p>
		<p>When a new instance of NamespaceRootIndex is created it will attempt to locate a file within the filesystem of the project it was created for called &quot;.topologyroots&quot;. If such a file exists the NamespaceRootIndex class will attempt to read the file ( properties file ) and parse out the values defined within it. The topologyroots file is a simple way of persisting the location of topology roots within a project between workspace restarts. It is a simple properties file that defines project relative paths within a project that should be represented as NamespaceFragmentRoots. The structure of the properties file is simple. Each property defined within it has the prefix &quot;root.path.&quot; with the last segment being a unique integer zero based and increasing in numerical order. The value of each property is the simple project relative path to a folder within the project. </p>
