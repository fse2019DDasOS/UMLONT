		<p>WAS uses special bindings files located alonside the normal J2EE deployment
		descriptors to define the special names that was uses to located J2EE services
		exposed in the J2EE modules and defined in the J2EE deployment descriptors.  These
		special bindings files are necessary for WAS to be able to find the appropriate 
		service on the server or within the application and map it to the correct J2EE 
		service defined within the J2EE deployment descriptor.   
		</p>
		<p>The <i>BindingProvider</i>s in this package hook into the capability provider
		extension point of the SOA Deploy Tools plugin to provide suppored J2EE module
		types with the information found in the WAS bindings files.  WAS bindings are
		modeled on the J2EE modules as <i>OverrideExpression</i>s and <i>OverrideAttribute</i>s
		occordingly.  The purpose of a WAS binding is to remap a declared J2EE service 
		to a known WAS service and that is the pattern that these BindingProviders follow
		as well.  They do not create new Capabilities or Requirements for a J2EE module
		but rather they provide a way of redirecting references away from names that 
		WAS cannot understand to names that WAS does understand.</p>
		<p>The <i>BindingProvider</i> type is a marker type that the J2EEModuleUnitProvider
		utilizes to ensure that they are called last in the list of CapabilityProviders
		when introspecting a type.  Since BindingProvider do not return any new requirements
		or capabilities they rely on the existence of other requirements and capabilities
		that they can then augment with OverrideExpressions and OverrideAttributes that 
		will represent the was bindings found in the bindings file for a particular J2EE
		module type.
		</p>
		<p>The bindings providers in this package should be registered with the capability
		providers extension point and should set the input enablement as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<ul>{inputEnablement}
				<ul>{and}
				    <ul>{test com.ibm.ccl...hasWasBindings=true}</ul>
				    <ul>{or}
				    	<ul>{instanceof org.eclipse.jst...EJBJar}</ul>
				    	<ul>{instanceof org.eclipse.jst...WebApp}</ul>
				    	<ul>{instanceof org.eclipse.jst...ApplicationClient}</ul>
				    	<ul>{instanceof org.eclipse.jst...Application}</ul>
				    </ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Note the use of the test in the above input enablement expression.  The purpose of
		this property tester is to ensure that a was bindings file exists for the J2EE module
		before the bindings are introspected.  Without this test in place a new was bindings
		file could possibly get created if one does not already exist.
