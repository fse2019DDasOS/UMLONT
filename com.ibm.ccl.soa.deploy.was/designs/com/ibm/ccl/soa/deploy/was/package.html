		<p>Shared libraries identify files used by multiple applications. 
		They are especially useful when you have different versions of the same framework used by different applications.
		</p>
		
		<p>A shared library definition in WebSphere consists of a symbolic name, a Java class path
		(including .jar files, .zip files and directories), and a native path for loading JNI 
		libraries.  A shared library can be defined at the cell, node, server or cluster scope.
		</p>
		
		<p>Milestone M5 will not support multi-dependency requirements (requirements that can be linked to 
		multiple capabilties, facets (sets of capabilties and requirements associated with a unit),
		nor constraints.
		Consequently, the design does not use these features.
		</p>
		
		<p>A shared library is modeled as a configuration unit with: 
		   <ul><li>a <a href="../SharedLibraryEntry.html">shared library capability</a>, and</li>
		       <li>a hosting requirement for a 
		       <a href="../WasConfigurationContainer">WebSphere configuration container</a>, and</li>
		       <li>an optional dependency requirement on a JarModule (<i>new for M5</i>).
		       Note that a valid dependency link to a JarModule should have the target's
		       artifacts listed in the classpath of the shared library. We currently do not 
		       model sufficient path information to validate this. However, we should be 
		       able to validate that the classpath contains an entry that ends in the names 
		       of each artifact (<i>new validation for M5</i>).</li>
		   </ul>
		</p>

		<p>When a dependency link from a shared library to a JarModule is created, the satisfied requirement 
		should be updated with requirement expressions that match the JarModule <tt>BundleCapability</tt>.
		Then enables version checking if JarModules are updated.  Further, an additional requirement should be
		added to the shared library enabling additional JarModules to be identified as party to the shared 
		library.
		</p>
		
		<p>In WebSphere, for the classes represented by the shared library to be loaded, it is necessary
		to associate the library with 
			<ul><li>an application,</li>
                <li>a Web module or</li>
                <li>the class loader of an application server</li>
            </ul>
		If the shared library is associated with an application, 
		it should not be associated with the class loader of an application server 
		(<i>new validation for M5</i>).
		Associating the library to the class loader of an application server makes the 
		library available to all applications on the server.
		In WebSphere, to associate a shared library with an application or a Web module, one creates
		shared library references from the application (Web modules).  To associate a shared
		library with an application server, a class loader is defined which references the 
		shared library.  This class loader is then associated with the application server.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In the tool, the associations between a shared library and an application or a 
		web module is expressed by a dependency link from the application (web module) to 
		a shared library.  The association between a shared library and an application 
		server is expressed by a dependency link from a class loader hosted on the
		application server to the shared library. To support this dependency link, an optional 
		requirement to a shared library should be added to an application and web modules when the
		application is hosted on WebSphere (and no unlinked requirement exists).  Each time a link
		to a shared library is created, a new requirment should be added (if there are no unlinked 
		requirements).  In this way, more than one shared library can be referenced by the 
		application (modules).
		</p>
		
		<p><b>M5 Work Items</b>
		</br>
		The following is required to implement shared library support:
		<ol>
		   <li>Modify templates for shared library to include optional dependency
		   requirement for JAR Module (BundleCapability).</li>
		   <li>Provide some classpath validation.</li>
		   <li>Validate that a shared library is not configured for access both by the server 
		   and by applications (or Web modules) on the server.  Take scope into account; ie,
		   shared library may be defined at the cell, cluster, node or server scope.</li>
		   <li>When host application module on WAS, 
		   add optional requirement for a shared library (if an unlinked requirement is not already present).
		   </li>
		   <li>When host application module on WAS,
		   add optional requirement for shared library to each Web module (if an unlinked requirement
		   is not already present).</li>
		   <li>When host Web module on WAS,
		   add optional requirement for shared library to the Web module (if an unlinked requirement
		   is not already present).</li>
		   <li>When a dependency link is created between a shared library requirement and a shared libary,
		   a new optional requirement should be added to the source's parent unit (if an unlinked requirement
		   is not already present).  This enables additional links so that multiple shared libraries can
		   be linked to an application.</li>
		   <li>The dependency link between a module and an external (i.e., not
		   part of the application) utility JAR should be validated to ensure:
		   	<ol><li>If <tt>sourceModule</tt> is a Web module, that sourceModule has a valid dependency
		   link to a shared library which, in turn, has a valid dependency link to <tt>targetJAR</tt>
		   (shared library is associated with a web module), or</li>
		   <li>That the application containing <tt>sourceModule</tt> has a valid dependency link
		   to a shared library which, in turn, has a valid dependency link to <tt>targetJAR</tt>
		   (shared library is associated with application), or</li>
		   <li>The container hosting the application containing <tt>sourceModule</tt> is hosted on also
		   hosts a class loader with a valid dependency link to a shared library (also hosted
		   on the same container) which, in turn, has a valid dependency link to <tt>targetJAR</tt>
		   (shared library is associated with the application server), and</li> 
		        <li>the container hosting the source module (or its application) provides a Java jre
		        capability that satisfies the <tt>Java.JRE</tt> requirement of target utility JAR.</li>
		    </ol></li>
		   <li>When a dependency link between a shared library and a <tt>JarModule</tt> is created,
		   the requirement should be updated to match the <tt>BundleCapability</tt> of the target.
		   This provides a mechanism for version checking later.</li>
		   <li>When a dependency link between a shared library and a <tt>JarModule</tt> is created,
		   a new optional <tt>BundleCapability</tt> requirement should be added to the source's parent unit
		   (if an unlinked requirement is not already present). This enables additional links so that
		   a shared library can reference many utility JARs.</li>
		   <li>Provide resolutions to configure shared library access for web modules, application
		   and application server (using existing or new shared library configurations).</li>
		</ol>

		<p>In WebSphere, class loader policies may be defined at various scopes:
		<ul><li>application server</li>
		    <li>application</li>
		    <li>Web module</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b><u>Application Server</u></b>
		A class loader policy value of <tt>SINGLE</tt> asserts that there is a single application 
		class loader is used to load all EJBs, utility JARs, and shared libraries within the 
		application server (JVM); ie, for all applications. 
		The <i>class loading mode</i> (or <i>order</i>) determines whether or not classes are loaded 
		parent first or parent last. </p>
		<p>A class loader policy value of <tt>MULTIPLE</tt> asserts that there is a separate class loader
		for the EJBs, utility JARs and shared libraries of each application.  In this case, the class loader
		mode is ignored. </p>
		<p>In both cases, If the (WAR) class loader policy defined at the application scope
		determines whether or not each Web module has its own class loader.
		</p>
		<p><b><u>Application</u></b>
		A class loader policy value of <tt>SINGLE</tt> asserts that each Web module will share the application
		class loader.  A value of <tt>MULTIPLE</tt> means that each Web module will have its own class loader.
		When the application server policy is <tt>MULTIPLE</tt> the mode defined at the application scope 
		determines the class loading order (parent first or parent last). </p>
		<p>At the application scope, one can specify whether or not classes should be reloaded when changed and 
		an interval for checking for changes.
		</p>
		<p><b><u>Web Module</u></b>
		If the application scope class loader policy is <tt>MULTIPLE</tt> the order defined at the web module scope
		determines the order (parent first or parent last) behavior of a web module class loader. </br>
		At the web module scope a <i>startWeight</i> can be specified which orders the initial loading of the
		Web modules.
		</p>
		
		<p><b><u>M5 Design Overview</u></b>
		Class loader policies are WebSphere specific but may be associated with the application (modules).  
		When an application is hosted on WebSphere requirements for class loader policies should be added to the
		application.  We will make these requirements be hosting requirements since they must be satisfied by
		capabilities of the hosting server. We will set the default values in the capabilities and allow users
		to override these defaults by modifying the application requirements.  There need not be a equality
		match between the attributes on the requirement and those on matching capability. For application 
		server class loader specification, a separate configuraiton unit is defined and hosted on the application
		server.
		</p>
		
		<p><b><u>M5 Work Items</u></b>
		<ol>
			<li>Define capabilities <tt>wasClassLoaderPolicy</tt>, <tt>wasModuleClassLoaderPolicy</tt>,
			<tt>wasApplicationClassLoaderPolicy</tt>, and <tt>wasApplicationServerClassLoaderPolicy</tt>.</li>
			<li>Define wasClassLoaderConfigurationUnit.</li>
			<li>Modify all templates containing a <tt>WebsphereApplicationServer</tt> to have capabilities:
			<tt>wasModuleClassLoaderPolicy</tt> and <tt>wasApplicationClassLoaderPolicy</tt>. Further
			modify the templates to host a <tt>wasClassLoaderConfigurationUnit</tt> with a 
			<tt>wasApplicationServerClassLoaderPolicy</tt> capability.</li>
			<li>Validate:<ul><li>Servers should have <tt>wasModuleClassLoaderPolicy</tt> capability.</li>
							<li>Servers should have <tt>wasApplicationClassLoaderPolicy</tt> capability.</li>
							<li>Servers should host a single <tt>wasClassLoaderConfigurationUnit</tt>.</li>
							<li>Attributes <i>reloadInterval</i> and <i>startWeight</i> should be greater than or equal to 0.</li>
							<li>An application server class loader policy value of <tt>SINGLE</tt> should be
							flagged as a warning (not best practice).</tt></li>
							<li><tt>wasClassLoaderConfigurationUnit</tt> validator.</li>
						</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Modify hosting link creation to add a hosting <tt>wasApplicationClassLoaderPolicy</tt> 
			requirement to an <tt>EarModule</tt> that is hosted on WebSphere.</li>
			<li>Modify hosting link creation to add a hosting <tt>wasModuleClassLoaderPolicy</tt> 
			requirement to an <tt>WebModule</tt> that is hosted on WebSphere.</li>
			<li>Create <tt>True</tt> requirement expression interpreter for specifying class loader policy.
			This interpreter should allow the requirement expression to match no matter the values of the attributes.</li>
			<li>Define icon for class loader policy configuration unit.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p><b><u>Design Implications</u></b>
		<ol>
			<li>Deployers wishing to use non-default values for class loader policies will need to set these
			policies in the requirements of the application module(s).</li>
			<li>Publishers will need to use the requirements to identify non-default class loader policies.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p><b><u>Future</u></b> (beyond M5)
		When a hosting link to WebSphere is deleted, the added requirements should also be deleted.  This is 
		most easily done if the requirements can be added as part of a WebSphere <i>facet</i>.
